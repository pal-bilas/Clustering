# This is all about Clustering

### Some of the clustering algorithms I rencently worked on.

#### I would like to switch my filed of study from Particle Physics to Big Data. All these are the practice exercise on clustwering. All or most of the exercises are taken from various online sources.   Kaggle, Udemy, IBM cognitive classes are  the examples of the sources I used to learn clustering algorithm.  

#### This repo contains this notebook:

- Private or public university with K means clustering.ipynb
- Customer segmentation with K means.ipynb
- Hierarchical clustering - Vehicle dataset.ipynb
- World Happiness Report - K means and Hierarchical clusterings.ipynb
